As tropical storms in Atlantic begin to formulate off the coast of west Africa, and gain steam they can turn into something significant, and reveal the dark side of Mother Nature.

In my capstone, I have created a visual representation of tropical storms/hurricane in the Atlantic Basin, which have impacted the US from the last 170 years.




## General Information
Are we having more hurricanes in the last 100 years?
Where are they hitting, is there a more common path?
Are they stronger (winds and category)
Is there the correlation to fatalities/damage to category and wind speed?



## Technologies Used
Python
Beautiful Soup
Excel
Tableau


## Features
The dashboard provide the user to toggle ~1000 Tropical Storms from the last 170 years and filter by several factors, specifically by State and Category.







## Project Status
Project is complete but there are still some functionality I would like to add. specifically add more interactive functionality with the tracks add more detail about each storm.


## Future Enhancements
As referenced about I will continue to
